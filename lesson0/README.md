# Lesson 0 - Getting prepared

Welcome to MobileProto! We're so excited for the upcoming semester. There are a few things that we'd like you to do before coming in to class on September 1st. Please submit this assignment **before** class on Thursday at 6:30 in order to receive credit. This assignment is worth 20 points.

## 1. Download and Install Android Studio

If you do this before class we'll have a lot more time to help you out and get started! Please download [Android Studio 2.1](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

*Note*: For those of you who already have Android Studio, it's important that you have the latest version. This makes it easier for us to help you with any problems you might have.

## 2. Set up github

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) our repo to your account. Finally, clone the repository and add our's as a remote named `upstream`:

```
cd some_directory  # wherever you want to store your MobileProto repo
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME/Mobile-Proto-16.git  # this should be the ssh clone address given to you by github
git remote add upstream git@github.com:MobileProto16/Mobile-Proto-16.git
```

If you are using Windows as your OS, make sure you have your git shell set up and working *before* class starts. You can download git shell for Windows [here](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). If you're using OSX version Maverick or later, git will already be present. Otherwise, start [downloading git here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) for Macs.

## 3. Join our slack channel [#mobileproto](https://olin.slack.com/messages/mobileproto/)

If you need any help, posting in slack will enable the promptest response and allow you to see any solutions to similar problems other people have had.
